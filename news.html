    <h5>August, 2018</h5>
        <!--Insert News below-->
    <p>Three papers have recently been accepted for presentation in <a href = "http://www.coord.c.titech.ac.jp/symp/sss2018/">The 20th International Symposium on Stabilization, Safety, and Security of Distributed Systems</a> (SSS 2018) to be held on November 04 - 07, 2018 at Tokyo, Japan. 
	The regular paper titled <b>An Adaptive Logging Framework for Persistent Memories</b> was co-authored by Dr. Sharma with his Ph.D. 
	student Pavan Poudel. This paper presents an adaptive logging framework to ensure crash consistency in persistent memory without any a priori knowledge on workload and contention scenario. The
	adaptive logging framework dynamically switches the execution using either undo logging or redo logging at the runtime with better performance. 
	The other paper titled <b>Load Balanced Distributed Directories</b> was co-authored by Dr. Sharma with his Ph.D. student Shishir Rai and Profs. Costas Busch from Louisiana State University and Maurice Herlihy from Brown University. The other paper titled <b>On Fast Pattern Formation by Autonomous Robots</b> was co-authored by Dr. Sharma with Profs. 
	Ramachandran Vaidyanathan and Jerry L. Trahan from Louisiana State University.  
    All the papers are listed in <a href = "publications.html"> publications</a> section.</p>
