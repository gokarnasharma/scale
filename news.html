	The regular paper titled <b>An Adaptive Logging Framework for Persistent Memories</b> was co-authored by Dr. Sharma with his Ph.D. 
	student Pavan Poudel. This paper presents an adaptive logging framework to ensure crash consistency in persistent memory without any a priori knowledge on workload and contention scenario. The
	adaptive logging framework dynamically switches the execution using either undo logging or redo logging at the runtime with better performance. 
	The other paper titled <b>Load Balanced Distributed Directories</b> was co-authored by Dr. Sharma with his Ph.D. student Shishir Rai and Profs. Costas Busch from Louisiana State University and Maurice Herlihy from Brown University.
